%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   Our lives are fully immersed by bills of every type. Every month we receive an average of 4-5 bills to pay about electricity, gas, water, internet and garbage furnitures and services. The goal of this work is to implement a classifier that automatically classify the bills that we received in the past. Given a batch of camera taken pictures of bills the application's task is to classify every bill and then store it inside the appropriate folder. In this way the app could organize better our finances lives. We build a sophisticated pipeline to handle the camera taken pictures, for then passing to an OCR that extract all the text contained in it. Then a simple Naive Bayes classifier is used in order to perform the classification. This is only the first step but it can be improved with more and sopphisticated features like the extraction of consumption, bill amount and deadlines and many more.

%%%%%%%%% BODY TEXT
\section{Introduction}

The purpose of our work is to classify bills about gas, water, garbage, internet and ellectricity furnitures and services. There are different aspects to take care of when dealing with camera taken photos, OCRs and document classification. For these reasons we develop a strong pipeline to manage different problems that could occur when dealing with these objects. Another important aspect when dealing with machine learning problems is getting a lot of data (in our case the bills) and the dataset construction. We will investigate all of these aspect in this paper. We are pretty sattisfied with this work because we reached a TODO\% of correct classification considering different metrics like... TODO    


\section{Related Work}
We couldn't have finded work that perform this particular task on the internet. However different aspect that we had to take care when develop this project have been taken into consideration by several works: primarily the problem of dewarping a camera taken image is essential for our application, in particular for pre-processing the image for the OCR and this problem was faced by \cite{Improvingcamera-based} with his project \cite{mobile-ocr} wich is based upon the experiments conducted by \cite{recoveringhomography}. The second task is to extact all the words contained in a bill: to face this task we relied on Tesseract \cite{Tesseract} wich is a popular open-source OCR developed by Goggle. The last major step is performing the classification wich could be performed by a Naive Bayes Classifier, TODO set references. 

\section{Dataset}
When dealing with machine learning applications, in general more data we have  better are the performances obtainable by these models, so the first approach for collecting datas is searching on the web if someone has posted some dataset that are useful for our application. Unfortunately for us on the web we couldn't have find a dataset for our purposed. So we decided to made our  dataset gathering all the bills that we could find. Our dataset is made of nearly 1000 bills: the majority of these are mobile camera taken photos (usually in jpg or png format) and only few ones are flatbed scans (in pdf format). We prefered to take more mobile camera photo because it reflects the traditional use-case of our app: take a bill's photo and classify it. The categories provided for our experimet are gas, water, electricity, garbage and internet furnitures, but the application could be trained on new categories. In table \ref{dataset-table} we have repoted the summary of our dataset.


\begin{table}[!h]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			\hline
			category    & quantity \\ \hline
			gas         & TODO     \\
			electricity & TODO     \\
			intenet     & TODO     \\
			water       & TODO     \\
			garbage     & TODO     \\ \hline
			total       & 1052     \\ \hline
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\label{dataset-table}
	\caption{Dataset composition}
\end{table}

Our dataset is mainly obtained with front-taken photos of bills, and no perspecitive distorsion or other strange effects are added to the photos, because these corrections are made in a prevoius phase with another neural-network (page-dewarping phase in the pipeline on figure \ref{pipeline}) which is trained on a completely different dataset. In this way we have the assumption that the document document are already dewarped (this tasks could be delegated with another application or coul be substituded) and we are ready to train the final classificator avoiding poor performance due to other previous pre-processing phases. We have noticed that the page-dewarping phase (wich is imported from the project mobile-ocr \cite{mobile-ocr}) have poor performances in some circumstances, so we decided to fine-tuning the nearal-network on a our specific dataset. We collected different photos about tables plot or other object that we could find in our homes. Then we applied the same approach as discussed in \cite{Improvingcamera-based} and in \cite{recoveringhomography} in the Dataset generation part to generate a synthetic dataset generation.


\section{Proposed Method}

We build a sopphisticated pipeline for this application because we ...

Parlare del fatto che allenare una pipeline più semplice come può essere una semplice rete cnns che imparasse a classificare direttamente una bolletta dando in pasto direttamente la foto sarebbe stato difficoltoso perche: innanzitutto per allenare una cnn sono richiesti molte foto di bollette anche molto diverse, inoltre se diamo in pasto una nuova bolletta di un fornitore completamente nuovo questo potrebbe non essere riconosciuta (mentre osservando le parole si, PROVARE COME ESPERIMENTO con una bolletta mai vista nella nostra applicazione). Questo sono le scelte principali che ci hanno portato a valutare la strada OCR così il classificatore per il testo ha bisogno di meno dati ed e in grado di classificare nuove bollette mai viste.

\subsection{Camera taken image quality}
Brightness and contrast enhancer 

We have noticed during the expiremets that we have poor performances in the OCR phase if the mobile taken photos isn't correctly illuminated. Tesseract OCR, wich is the application designated for extracting the text of our bill in our application, already apply internally a pre-processing step, trying to binarize the image for then extraction the text. The problem of this approach arise when the taken photos have bad illumination or there are shadows present on the bills. Infact we could see in the example reported in figure \ref{figure-illuminance-problem} that if we take a poor illuminated photo of a bill and we exctract the pre-proccesing output of Tesseract we can noticed that there are completly black areas on the pre-processed photos. For this reason we try to enhance the contrast and the brightness of the image to see if the peformance could be better. In figure TODO we take the same image as example but this time the image have more contrast and brightness apply. In this case we could appreciate that the pre-proccessed image of Tesseract is better and infact the OCR extact more words. For this reason we have inserted in the pipeline an Brightness and Constrast Enhancer for all the mobile taken photos (the jpg format), because we have seen that also if the immage is already correctly illuminated and costrasted, even if we apply the enhancer, the performance are the same.

\section{Formatting your paper}

All text must be in a two-column format. The total allowable width of the
text area is $6\frac78$ inches (17.5 cm) wide by $8\frac78$ inches (22.54
cm) high. Columns are to be $3\frac14$ inches (8.25 cm) wide, with a
$\frac{5}{16}$ inch (0.8 cm) space between them. The main title (on the
first page) should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from the top edge of the
page. The second and following pages should begin 1.0 inch (2.54 cm) from
the top edge. On all pages, the bottom margin should be 1-1/8 inches (2.86
cm) from the bottom edge of the page for $8.5 \times 11$-inch paper; for A4
paper, approximately 1-5/8 inches (4.13 cm) from the bottom edge of the
page.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Margins and page numbering}

All printed material, including text, illustrations, and charts, must be kept
within a print area 6-7/8 inches (17.5 cm) wide by 8-7/8 inches (22.54 cm)
high.
Page numbers should be in footer with page numbers, centered and .75
inches from the bottom of the page and make it start at the correct page
number rather than the 4321 in the example.  To do this fine the line (around
line 23)
\begin{verbatim}
%\ifcvprfinal\pagestyle{empty}\fi
\setcounter{page}{4321}
\end{verbatim}
where the number 4321 is your assigned starting page.

Make sure the first page is numbered by commenting out the first page being
empty on line 46
\begin{verbatim}
%\thispagestyle{empty}
\end{verbatim}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Type-style and fonts}

Wherever Times is specified, Times Roman may also be used. If neither is
available on your word processor, please use the font closest in
appearance to Times to which you have access.

MAIN TITLE. Center the title 1-3/8 inches (3.49 cm) from the top edge of
the first page. The title should be in Times 14-point, boldface type.
Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and
adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or
prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Leave two blank
lines after the title.

AUTHOR NAME(s) and AFFILIATION(s) are to be centered beneath the title
and printed in Times 12-point, non-boldface type. This information is to
be followed by two blank lines.

The ABSTRACT and MAIN TEXT are to be in a two-column format.

MAIN TEXT. Type main text in 10-point Times, single-spaced. Do NOT use
double-spacing. All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6
inch or 0.422 cm). Make sure your text is fully justified---that is,
flush left and flush right. Please do not place any additional blank
lines between paragraphs.

Figure and table captions should be 9-point Roman type as in
Table~\ref{mytable}. Short captions should be centred.

\noindent Callouts should be 9-point Helvetica, non-boldface type.
Initially capitalize only the first word of section titles and first-,
second-, and third-order headings.

FIRST-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, {\large \bf 1. Introduction})
should be Times 12-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one blank line after.

SECOND-ORDER HEADINGS. (For example, { \bf 1.1. Database elements})
should be Times 11-point boldface, initially capitalized, flush left,
with one blank line before, and one after. If you require a third-order
heading (we discourage it), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially
capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, followed by a period
and your text on the same line.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Footnotes}

Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like.  It
often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral
observations in
the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence).  If you
wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on
which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{References}

List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times,
single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text,
enclose the citation number in square brackets, for
example~\cite{Authors14}.  Where appropriate, include the name(s) of
editors of referenced books.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
Method & Frobnability \\
\hline\hline
Theirs & Frumpy \\
Yours & Frobbly \\
Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results. Ours is better.}
\label{mytable}
\end{table}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Illustrations, graphs, and photographs}

All graphics should be centered.  Please ensure that any point you wish to
make is resolvable in a printed copy of the paper.  Resize fonts in figures
to match the font in the body text, and choose line widths which render
effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers), even of an electronic
copy, will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You cannot
insist that they do otherwise, and therefore must not assume that they can
zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

When placing figures in \LaTeX, it's almost always best to use
\verb+\includegraphics+, and to specify the  figure width as a multiple of
the line width as in the example below
{\small\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ...
   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]
                   {myfile.eps}
\end{verbatim}
}
